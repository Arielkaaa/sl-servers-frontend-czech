# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build/Run Commands
- `yarn start` - Start development server on port 3185
- `yarn build` - Build production version
- `yarn test` - Run all tests
- `yarn test src/path/to/test.js` - Run a specific test file

## Code Style Guidelines
- React components use JSX syntax with `.jsx` file extension
- Functional components with hooks are preferred over class components
- Redux for state management with async actions using thunks
- Import order: React, third-party libraries, local components, styles
- Use destructuring for props and state variables
- Component file names use PascalCase (e.g., `ServerList.jsx`)
- Utility files use camelCase (e.g., `apiClient.js`)
- CSS modules with specific files for component styles
- Error handling should use try/catch with appropriate error dispatch
- i18n/localization uses i18next with separate locale files

## Project Structure
- `/src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `/src/pages/` - Page-level components for routes
- `/src/modules/` - Redux actions, reducers, and selectors
- `/src/i18n/` - Internationalization configuration and files
