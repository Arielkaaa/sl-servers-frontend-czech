## Coding Conventions

- React components use JSX syntax with `.jsx` file extension
- Functional components with hooks are preferred over class components
- Redux for state management with async actions using thunks
- Import order: React, third-party libraries, local components, styles
- Use destructuring for props and state variables
- Component file names use PascalCase (e.g., `ServerList.jsx`)
- Utility files use camelCase (e.g., `apiClient.js`)
- CSS modules with specific files for component styles
- Error handling should use try/catch with appropriate error dispatch
- i18n/localization uses i18next with separate locale files
